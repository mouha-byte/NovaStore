case '/landing':
  final product = settings.arguments as ProductModel;
  return MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (_) => LandingPageScreen(product: product),
  );
```

### Example Integration
```dart
// Add a "View Landing Page" button in product screen
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.pushNamed(
      context,
      '/landing',
      arguments: widget.product,
    );
  },
  child: Text('View Promotional Page'),
)
```

## Customization

### Modify Features
Edit the `features` list in `_buildFeaturesGrid()`:
```dart
final features = [
  {
    'icon': Icons.your_icon,
    'title': 'Your Feature',
    'description': 'Your description',
  },
  // Add more features...
];
```

Edit the `testimonials` list in `_buildTestimonialsGrid()`:
```dart
final testimonials = [
  {
    'name': 'Customer Name',
    'role': 'Verified Buyer',
    'rating': 5,
    'text': 'Review text...',
    'image': 'https://your-image-url.com',
  },
  // Add more testimonials...
